# /!\ CURRENTLY NOT WORKING /!\

# Description

This is a fork from https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-tt-rss

The LinuxServer is now archived and not available in Docker Hub anymore; this is my version.

I remove the TTRSS version check and use the last one (master): https://tt-rss.org/

## How to use

`docker build --no-cache --pull -t reedcrif/ttrss: .`
